# Bank-Marketing-Data-Visualization
The data in this project is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not subscribed ('no') by the clients. By visualizing the data, this project aims at predicting the features of the client who will subscribe.
